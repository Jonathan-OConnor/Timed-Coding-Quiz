# Timed-Coding-Quiz

## Description:
This is a short timed quiz. Once the start button is pressed, a question will be presented to the user. If the user gets the question incorrect, 10 seconds is deducted for their time. At the end of the quiz, the user is prompted to enter their initials. Once the user has submitted their initials, they are taken to a highscore page which displays past initials and scores.
